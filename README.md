# CPU Implementations
### Naive GEMM (General Matrix Multiplication) on CPU
The naive GEMM implementation performs matrix multiplication on the CPU using a simple triple-loop approach. It multiplies two square matrices of size N and measures the execution time.

### Naive SpMV (Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication) on CPU
The naive SpMV implementation performs sparse matrix-vector multiplication on the CPU using a simple double-loop approach. It multiplies a randomly generated sparse matrix with a vector and measures the execution time.

### Multi-threaded GEMM (General Matrix Multiplication) on CPU
The multi-threaded GEMM implementation utilizes OpenMP for parallelization. It performs matrix multiplication on the CPU using a tiled approach and measures the execution time.

### Multi-threaded SpMV (Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication) on CPU
The multi-threaded SpMV implementation utilizes OpenMP for parallelization. It performs sparse matrix-vector multiplication on the CPU using memory coalescing and measures the execution time.
